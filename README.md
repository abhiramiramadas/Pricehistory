**aka:** *“Why pay full price when you can emotionally damage websites until they leak discounts?”*

## 💡 What is this?

This is my highly-engineered, extremely-professional, absolutely-not-held-together-by-scotch-tape Python bot that:

* 🕵️ stalks iPhone prices
* 🧠 remembers them better than I remember my math formulas
* 📉 screams at me on Telegram when the price drops
* 🧮 stores everything in a database because Google Sheets was “too mainstream”
* 📊 generates graphs so I can pretend I'm doing data science

**In short:**
**Retail therapy, but automated.**

## ⚙️ How it works (in human words)

1. Bot wakes up
2. Checks **Flipkart**, **Amazon**, **myG**
3. Sees if the iPhone price is acting cheap today
4. If yes → sends me a message like

   > “abby THE PRICE FELL RUN RUN RUN”
5. Logs everything in CSV/DB
6. Draws graphs like Picasso (thanks matplotlib)
7. Goes back to sleep
8. Repeats because **GitHub Actions = unpaid intern**

## 🐍 Installation

If you want to run this on your machine (idk why):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhiramiramadas/Pricehistory
cd Pricehistory
pip install -r requirements.txt
python price_tracker.py
```

If it breaks → **it’s a feature.**

## 🤖 Automation Gang

This repo uses **GitHub Actions** because I don’t like:

* alarms
* reminders
* responsibility

So GitHub does the checking while I do… other things.
Like breathing.
Or not breathing.
Depends on semester.

## 📬 Telegram Alerts

You’ll receive beautiful messages like:

> **📉 PRICE DROP DETECTED:**
> Get your wallet.
> Or don’t. I’m not your mom.

They appear instantly because my bot is clingy.

## 📊 Dashboard

A whole **HTML dashboard** exists because data is prettier with colors.
Graphs included.
Looks like a *“stocks chart”*
but is actually just me monitoring iPhone prices like a Wall Street NPC.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* No warranty.
* No promise it won’t panic and say your phone costs **5 million rupees**.
* Flipkart blocks me sometimes because I’m “too powerful”.
  I respect that.
